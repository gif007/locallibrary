# MDN Local Library

This project is a web based library application written using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework and based on the [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django) at Mozilla Developers Network. It utilizes many of Django's built in classes and functions to create a fully functional dynamic website with data persistence, user authentication, forms and many other features.
